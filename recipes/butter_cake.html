    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Scrunching phyllo and tucking it into a baking pan had a serious moment on social media recently. We added brown butter for a rich, nutty flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 (3-inch) cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) package frozen phyllo dough, thawed</li>
        <li>3/4 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>For brown butter, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat and simmer, stirring frequently, until browned, fragrant, and foamy with brown bits in it, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and pour into a small heat-safe bowl. Let cool.</li>
        <li>For syrup, stir together sugar, water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce heat to low; simmer until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stack 2 phyllo sheets; starting with a short end, fold accordion-style into a strip, using approximately 1 1/2-inch folds. Arrange folded phyllo along the short end of prepared pan. (Keep remaining phyllo covered with a clean, damp kitchen towel while you work.)</li>
        <li>Repeat stacking and folding with remaining phyllo, evenly spacing strips in the pan. Bake for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the oven. Stir cooled brown butter, then drizzle over phyllo. Bake for 10 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk together milk, eggs, vanilla, and salt in a 2-cup liquid measuring cup until combined. Pour egg mixture evenly over phyllo. Bake until golden, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour syrup over the warm cake (discard cinnamon stick). Let cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Cut into 20 squares. Serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
